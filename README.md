## Problems

0. Given a line of N positive integers, what is the supremun?
	- Input:
		N, then N numbers
	- Output:
		The largest of the N numbers

1. Given a line of N positive integers, what is the infimum?
	- Input:
		N, then N numbers
	- Output:
		The smallest of the N numbers

2. Given a line of N numbers, what is the difference between the infimum and supremum?
	- Input:
		N, then N numbers
	- Output:
		The distance from the smallest number to the largest

3. Given N lines of numbers x and y, which is bigger?
	- Input:
		N pairs of x and y
	- Output:
		N integers, the larger of x and y in each case

4. Given N rectangles with sides x and y, what is their area?
	- Input:
		An integer, N, then N tuples of x and y
	- Output:
		A single integer with the area

5. Given M lists of N numbers, what is the supremum?
	- Input:
		An integer, M, then M lines,
		each line starting with an integer N, then N numbers
	- Output:
		For each line, a single integer, the highest number in the line

6. Given M lists of N numbers, what is the sum of the positive numbers?
	- Input:
		An integer, M, then M lines,
		each line starting with an integer N, then N numbers
	- Output:
		For each line, a single integer, the sum of the positive numbers
		in the line

7. Given N numbers, how many digits does each contain?
	- Input:
		An integer, N, then N integers
	- Output:
		N integers, the number of digits in each integer
